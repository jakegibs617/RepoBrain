## 2026-07-09 — Milestones 1–2 (skeleton, storage, search)

### D1: SQLite tables only, no graph library abstraction

The graph is plain `nodes` / `edges` tables in SQLite (WAL mode) with indexes
on `path`, `type`, `name`, and edge endpoints. No networkx/graph-DB layer.
Rationale: PRD recommends SQLite-only for MVP; every planned query (neighbors,
path lookup, type counts) is a simple indexed SQL query, and provenance lives
naturally in columns.

### D2: Deterministic content-addressed IDs

- Node id = `sha1(type \x00 qualified_name-or-name \x00 path)`
- Edge id = `sha1(type \x00 source_id \x00 target_id \x00 path \x00 start_line)`

Rationale: incremental reconciliation becomes idempotent upserts — re-parsing
an unchanged file regenerates identical IDs, so `INSERT ... ON CONFLICT`
converges instead of duplicating. `created_at` is preserved on conflict;
`updated_at`/`last_seen_at` refresh. Trade-off: renaming a heading or moving a
file produces a new ID (old row is deleted via path-based cleanup), so node
identity does not survive renames. Acceptable for MVP.

### D3: fnmatch-based gitignore subset

`.gitignore` and `.repobrainignore` are parsed with a small fnmatch-based
matcher: comments, blank lines, trailing-`/` directory patterns, leading-`/`
anchoring, and `*`/`?`/`[...]` globs. Negation (`!`), nested per-directory
`.gitignore` files, and true `**` semantics are NOT supported (lines starting
with `!` are skipped). Rationale: avoids a new dependency; the PRD's default
excludes cover the common noise. Revisit with `pathspec` if fidelity becomes a
problem.

### D4: FTS5 design — one contentful table, rows per file AND per section

`content_fts(path, name, content)` is a regular (contentful) FTS5 table. The
generic file parser inserts one row per text file (name = basename, content =
whole file); the Markdown parser additionally inserts one row per section
(name = heading, content = section text). Sync strategy: on re-index, all FTS
rows for changed/deleted paths are deleted before re-inserting, inside the
same transaction as node/edge updates. Search results join back to `nodes` on
`(path, name)` to recover node type and line spans — chosen over adding an
UNINDEXED node_id column to keep the FTS schema exactly as specified; the
join is heuristic when a file and document share a basename, resolved by a
type-preference ORDER BY.

### D5: Parsers may stack; ParseResult carries FTS rows

The indexer runs every registered parser whose `can_parse` returns true, so a
Markdown file gets both the generic File node and the Markdown document/section
nodes. `ParseResult` gained a fourth field, `fts_rows`, beyond the PRD's
`(nodes, edges, warnings)` — parsers are the only place that knows which text
belongs in full-text search (e.g. per-section content), and the indexer just
flushes them.

### D6: Directory nodes derived from file paths; cleanup by liveness

Directory nodes/edges are emitted by the generic file parser from each file's
ancestor chain. Edge provenance paths point at the child (dir→file edge has
the file's path), so deleting a file removes exactly its edges. After
deletions, Directory nodes whose path no longer prefixes any active file are
swept, then orphan edges (dangling endpoints) are deleted globally.

### D7: Search scoring = -bm25 + additive boosts

FTS relevance is `-bm25()` (higher is better, typically 0–3), with additive
boosts: exact name match +100, partial name match +25, path substring +10.
Rationale: PRD 19 says source-grounded exact matches should outrank vague
content matches; the large exact-name boost guarantees that ordering without
tuning.

### D8: Store paths relative to the indexed root; db lives in CWD

`repobrain index PATH` keeps its database in the current directory's
`.repobrain/` but stores file paths relative to PATH. One repository per
database (PRD 8: one local repository at a time). `.repobrain/` is gitignored
— treated as a local cache per PRD 30 recommended default #5, while Markdown
memory files (AGENT_HANDOFF.md, DECISIONS.md) are committed.

### D9: Tasks limited to TODO/FIXME list items

Markdown Task nodes are created only for list items whose text (after
stripping a `[ ]`/`[x]` checkbox prefix) contains the word TODO or FIXME.
Plain checkboxes without TODO/FIXME are not tasks yet — prefer precision over
recall at first (PRD 30 #8).
